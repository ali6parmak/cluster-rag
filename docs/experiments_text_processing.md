# Text-processing track — experiment log

Append-only narrative log for the text-processing / segmentation track
(`TEXT_PROCESSING_PLAN.md`, revised 2026-10-23). One short section per run:
date, run_id, what was run, the numbers, the verdict.

The rules that bind this log (AGENTS.md plus the track plan):

- **Every number comes from a run artifact first** — `results/<run_id>/` — and
  is written here afterwards. No hand-written tables: the comparison tables
  are auto-appended by the CLI commands into
  `docs/experiments_table_text_processing_omct.md` (and
  `docs/experiments_table_text_processing_upr.md` once the UPR stage starts),
  upserted by run key.
- **Old entries are never edited.** A corrected run is appended as a new
  entry that says what changed.
- **OMCT is auxiliary.** The OMCT pairwise data (`omct-` run ids) is model
  selection, threshold evidence and reranker/fine-tune training material. Its
  findings annotate method choice; they are never a UPR metric. UPR numbers
  always name the split (val/test) they come from.
- **Comparisons are paired** and reported with a CI; no verdict rests on two
  independent AUCs.
- **The two negative subsets are never pooled**: A = the reviewer-verified
  hard negatives (the evaluation set), B = sampled *unjudged* same-document
  pairs (a control and a training source, never ground truth). B carries no
  label of its own: it is "unjudged", or "presumed-negative" where a
  label-shaped number is unavoidable — always flagged as such.
- **Raw data is read-only.** An LLM may score pairs; it may never relabel,
  curate or clean them.

## Change sets

Infrastructure change sets (no run artifact, hence no numbers):

- **CS-0 (2026-10-23) — skeleton.** The track's package
  (`src/cluster_rag/text_processors/`: the `Chunker` / `FeatureExtractor` /
  `Combiner` ports plus the `full_text` and `atoms` chunkers), the track's
  sweep directory `experiments_text_processing/` (the sweep loader keeps
  `experiments/` importable, so `embedder_pool.MODELS` stays shared), the
  track's log (this file) and its OMCT comparison table, and the
  command-derived command → (dataset, track) → table-file mapping with the
  new `paths.experiment_table_text_processing_omct` / `_upr` config keys.
  No run, no metric.

## Decisions (design, settled before the first run)

Recorded here so the numbers in CS-1's artifact have a stated design behind
them. The decisions themselves live in `TEXT_PROCESSING_PLAN.md` §3 Stage 0.

- **2026-10-23 — the control set (subset B).** Built from the **unjudged**
  cells (pairs with no record in `omct_pairs.json`): same-document grid →
  drop every judged cell → group the rest by document → seeded, proportional
  sample per document (seed from the config). Default **n = 4,000**
  (NU ~1,618 / CIDH ~2,210 / AI ~171; the AI stratum is the binding
  constraint). The dataset file is never modified — the control is derived
  and reproducible from the seed.
- **2026-10-23 — the reporting rule.** Every method number comes with its
  control-side counterpart: the change in AUC on the reviewed set
  (discrimination) sits next to the change in score level and rank position
  on the control (scale and mechanical gain). A method counts as a win only
  if the discrimination gain survives the scale shift.
- **2026-10-23 — models for the Stage-0 artifact:** `embeddinggemma`,
  `voyage-4-nano`, `arctic2` (warm cache; no re-encoding).
- **2026-10-23 — no human labelling.** The rate at which the unjudged cells
  hide true positives is **not measured**; the track's safe-negative rule
  therefore ships as the margin half only. Stated as a limitation in CS-2.

## Runs

_No runs yet — the first artifact run is CS-1's `analyze-omct` (Stage 0.1)._
